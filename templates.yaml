  Welcome to the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign virtual tutor skill.
  Say "help" for more information on what I can do.
help: |
  My main function is to help you solve the problems on your courses.
  For example, you can say, "final exam", to get the final exam information on your courses.
  For information on which courses I know about, say "what courses are supported?"
  Or say, "CS 225", and I will partner with your course if it is supported and ask you questions to help narrow down your query.
